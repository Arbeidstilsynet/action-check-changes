# Arbeidstilsynet/action-check-changes

Action to check for changes to files since last successful workflow run.

This action can be used for safe continuous delivery/deployment taking into consideration previous runs.

## Versioning

This repository uses a simple versioning system based on the `VERSION` file.
When you update the `VERSION` file and push to `main`, a Git tag with that version is created or updated automatically by the workflow.
If you have to make breaking changes to the action, bump the version.

## Requirements

Requires full commit history. When configuring [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout), make sure to set `fetch-depth: 0`.

The job must have permission for `actions: read` for the action to retrieve run history through the GitHub API.

| `token`         | Yes      |               | GitHub token for API access (Actions:Read)                                                                                                                                  |
| `include-paths` | Yes      |               | Newline separated Git pathspecs (globs) to include in the diff scope (e.g. `src/`, `app/**/*.ts`).                                                                          |
| `exclude-paths` | No       | (empty)       | Newline separated Git pathspecs to exclude. Each is applied as `:(exclude)<pattern>`.                                                                                       |
